/**
 * A2: typed per-attempt output markers for the STRUCTURAL rotation predicate.
 *
 * `sawAgentProgress` proves the agent demonstrably started working under the
 * current credential — after that, a credential rotation would silently replay
 * work (and any external side effects a tool call already performed), so the
 * structural branch must never fire. The policy is deliberately NARROWER than
 * the inactivity watchdog's `countsAsAgentProgress`: `message` and `error`
 * events do NOT count, because a vendor's limit/failure prose arriving as a
 * message must never block the structural branch (the exact incident class
 * this predicate exists to close), and `status` events are lifecycle/failure
 * disclosures, never model work.
 *
 * `fileChanges` counts typed `file_change` events WITHOUT requiring a tool ref
 * (adapters legitimately emit tool-less file_change frames), so the mutation
 * guard sees every disclosed write even when the workspace diff is empty or —
 * in the read-only lane — no workspace exists at all.
