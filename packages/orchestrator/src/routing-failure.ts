 * rotation has to pick its ready profile before the budget router filters the
 * exhausted default away). That placement means a typed refusal thrown by the
 * profile preflight — `subscription_window_exhausted` and its `resetsAt` — never
 * reaches the per-slot catch that records a candidate's `declaredFailure`, so
 * the routing terminal is the only place left that can state it. Dropping it
 * here would hand a scheduler `code: null` and leave it parsing prose for the
 * one fact it needs: when to come back.
